## Caution

- Never set the apply method to `Auto apply` in Terraform Cloud for this repo, it would be too dangerous because it manages your whole infrastructure.
- You should review your plans twice: once in pull requests and once before applying, ideally by two different persons.
- You should regularly update oStack to benefit from the latest bug fixes and features. Always check your new plan before applying the update.
